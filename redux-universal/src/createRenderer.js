 * Creates a universal render function.

 * and all current promises are resolved.
 *
 * The inner workings of the repetitive rendering require that each watched
 * promise also dispatches an action when it is resolved or rejected. Using it
 * together with a middleware that handles promises from synchronous action
 * creators is encouraged.
